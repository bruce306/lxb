lxb is an X/Motif interactive graphical user interface builder. With it you 
can build GUI made up of Motif widgets instantiated by clicking on icons, move 
and resize them with the mouse, and edit their resources. During the build
of the GUI you can place it in "Play" mode and test how the GUI built will look
and act. Once the GUI is built, pressing a button will produce the required C 
source and header files to build the GUI, and an X resource file and Makefile. 

lxb is a work in progress. Many but not all Motif widgets are available, and
many but not all resources can be edited. There are many features of a good GUI 
builder yet to be done. Anyone that would like to add develoment is welcome. 
I know that Motif is a "Legacy" GUI toolkit, but is object orientated in its 
design, and working on this program could be used to develop other GUI toolkits.
Anyone that would like  to contribute is welcome and can contact me at my email 
listed on Github.

The lxb program, in addtion to X/Motif C code, also outputs a file that defines
the GUI app being built. This is the "lxb save file" and is a file that defines
the GUI with data structures and data. This file could be used to develop other 
GUI toolkits and code if anyone would like to contribute.

Bruce.
