What's New in Version 0.51 of lxb
---------------------------------

This is really a minor release. Little has changed since the
original one done for X11R5 and Motif 1.1 on a 486. I am 
working on a more major release (0.6) that I hope to have out
soon.


Changes:
--------

- bug fixes.

- added fallback resources so that Lxb-ad no longer needs be used

- updated some of the code (fe, appcontext functions)
