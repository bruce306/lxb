<h2>LXB - Linux X11/Motif GUI Builder</h2>
</center>

<p>

<p>
<h3>A Brief Description</h3>
<p>

	lxb is an X/Motif interactive graphical user interface builder. With
	it you can build a GUI made up of Motif widgets instantiated from a
	pallet, move and resize them, edit their resources, and move about in 
	the widget heirarchy. Once the GUI is built, pressing a button will 
	produce the required C source files to build the GUI, and an X resource 
	file and Makefile.   

<p> 

	Please note that lxb is a work in progress. Not all Motif widgets are 
	available, nor can all resources be edited. There are many features of
	a good GUI builder yet to be done.

<h3>System Requirements</h3>
<p>
	If compiling source to produce your lxb program, there should be no
 	special system requirements. However, I found many packages had to be
	installed to compile it successfully. These are specific to your
	Unix/Linux version. Current development was done on Ubuntu V20 on a 
	64-bit machine.

<p>
<h3>Current Version</h3>
<p>
	As of 02/2022 the current version is 0.61 and can be found on Github. 

<p>
<h3>Feedback Appreciated</h3>
<p>

	Please direct any feedback to my email on Github. If anyone wishes to do 
	additional work on this please let me know. A possible direction to go 
	is to add the capability of code output in Python or with other GUI toolkits.
