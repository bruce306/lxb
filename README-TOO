- I got Motif from the official source. But there is also the
	legacy software LessTiff - an open source version of Motif.
 	I found out that with this release there was no need to 
	use your own built Motif

- System Depends:
	I found many packages were required to be installed other
	than the default packages that come with the base Ubuntu v20.
	I did not keep track of them all. Sorry.
