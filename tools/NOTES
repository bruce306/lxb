THE NOTES
---------

This directory contains data files that the programs in this directory 
convert into header files copied into the include directory for lxb and
made much use of.

This directory is concerned with the X resources for the Motif widgets,
their data type size, their Enumerated values, and so on. The programs
source code should not be touched - unless you understand completely
what you are doing - as the rest of lxb depends on the end result *.h
files created to be in an exact format.

PLEASE NOTE FOR YOUR OWN GOOD
-----------------------------

To add new resources make sure you know what each file and all its entries
mean. Also be aware that certain resources were not done because they can
not be edited except at creation time, automatically set by other resources,
depend on the parent widget, or you name it: these cases cannot be handled
yet by lxb so I just don't allow the resource to be edited.

BUT, IF YOU INSIST ON ADDING RESOURCES
-------------------------------------- 
0) 	Make backup copies of the 3 data files listed below.

1)  The xtypes file is pretty static; you should not have to add to it. You
		should verify that the datatype of the X resource that you are adding is
		listed in it, but most likely it will be.

2)	Check the xres file to see if the resource name (without the "XmN") is 
		listed or not. If not, there make an entry for it. The various fields
		are sort of described below.

3)	If the resource added has Enumerated types for values of the resource
		then check the xenum file to see if an entry exists for it. If not, add
		one. Again, make sure you know what each field is.

4)	Type make. This will remake any conversion programs required (which I
		doubt will be needed), and remake the header files from any data files
		you might have modified. Then the end result will be copied into lxb's
		include directory. Then you are done in this directory.

DATA FILES
----------

1)	xtypes: is a unique list of the X types only; added manually.

2)	xres: All possible resource types; added manually for each widget.

3)	xenum: The Enumerated types in C struct format; done by hand; src is Xm.h

		----------		--------		------			-----------		-------				------
1)	xtypes		-->	(ss)		-->	getsizes.c 	->.......->		getsizes -->	tmpsizes	-->

3) 	xenum			-->	cp			-->	xenum.h 

################################################################################

xres file format:
-----------------

	The 1st field is the resource name without "XmN"; a string.
	The 2nd field is the resource datatype, a string;
	The 3rd field is an integer number.

	3rd Field: (n, a number)
	------------------------

		0,1,2...:		an index into xenum.h, and an enumerated type.
			
		-999		:		not enumerated, ignore this field, a simple resource type
		
		-100		:		To Be Done - not implemented yet.
	
		n < 0		: 	Special Resources - require special processing

		-1			:			a Pixel (color)
		-2			:			a Widget 
		-3			:			an XmString
		-4			:			a fontList
		-5			:			a sibling widget (same parent; XmForm)
