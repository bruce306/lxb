This is the editres program source written by the X people
ported to v16 of ubuntu

2/22 - compiled on my system without any of the messy stuff
below.

1.9/18 - When run it may start iconified on the launch area. 
if so to run it double click on the icon in that area.

------------------------------------------------------------

To compile for Ubuntu v16 you should be able to
just type "make", providing you have the required
X includes and libs and 

.. change the home location in the Makefile

You get some compiler warnings now but they should not
matter....

The below is i'm not sure valid anymore....

		  Instructions for building Editres.

Editres depends on the _EresInsert<something> and
_EresRetrieve<something> routines that are are implemented and used by
"EditresCom.c".  Since this module is intended to be included in your
widget library or toolkit, editres should automatically link in the
module, but if you have not included that module into your library you
will need to edit the makefile to make sure that editres links in this
file.
